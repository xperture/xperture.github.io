### How we work 
I remind myself often to revisit my intentions. I work with reusability and readability in mind. I strive to create code that will endure through time. I want the user, be they developer or customer, to feel their needs were intuited. I approach the task at hand with curiosity and humility. This allows me to take roadblocks in stride, and savor opportunities to learn and absorb information which will help me build better next time.
